# Homework 4 - CMP_SCI 3330 SP24
This project is a vehicle data processing program. It takes data from .csv file and reads it into an ArrayList of vehicles so calculations can be made from it like average fuel economy, and also provides information to the user like printing all vehicles of specific types and other information about the vehicles that can be deduced from the data.

### Usage

This project was developed using Java Dev Kit version 21. In order to run this code you will need to have JDK 21 selected as you Java Runtime Environment within your IDE. 

We have provided a test Main.java to perform many of the operations provided, however, if you would like to create your own main you can just create it within the package and use it instead.

To run within any file just hit play!

### Dependencies

An example csv is within the files folder. It should be noted that the file path is hard coded as a constant within the singleton class. If you wish to test different data you will need to change that file path. The implementation also expects a specific csv format and will only work with that format.
